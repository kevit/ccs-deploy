Hi all.

Please check results.

>1 What is virtual Memory?
That is a address space mapped by process

>1.1 Is there a command that would show the system to be in such a state?
Yes, major is vmstat/sar

>1.2 Can the kernel swap to a ramdisk?
Yes, if ramdisk is a normal block device, why not?

>1.3 How can a 32-bit system use more than 4GB of RAM?
By using PAE

>2. What is a filesystem?
That is a way to organize data on the OS kernel. Typically usage is a provide access to bundle of data (files) on block devices

>2.1 What is an access control list? How is it used in Linux?
That is a table to describe user privileges. It used because unix file permissions cannot provide selective access per user, only per owner/group

>2.2 Is it possible to have a hard link spanning two files in different filesystems? What is the reason?
No, because hardlink is a directory file record, whose describe the same filesystem inode.

> 3. The directory /data is mounted via NFS:
192.168.1.105:/data on /data type nfs (rw,soft,intr,addr=192.168.1.105)
>3.1 Even though permissions are set correctly in the local system, root can not create files on it. What are the probable causes of this happening?
By default remote root user receive a different userid with nobody rights
 
>3.2 What are the main differences between NFSv2, NFSv3 and NFSv4?
NFSv2 is UDP only, NFSv3 is stateless and support async write, NFSv4 is TCP only and heading file locking properly.

>3.3 What daemons are necessary to be running on an NFS server if a client wants to mount an NFSv3 share?
nfs, portmapper, nlockmgr, rquotad  and mountd.

>3.4 An NFS server is very loaded, running 8 nfsd threads. How can one prove to the sysadmin that it is necessary to increase the number of NFS threads?
Show "nfsstat -rc" retransmissions counter to your sysadmin. If growing - number of threads should be increased.
